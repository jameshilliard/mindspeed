This folder contains tools supporting secure boot of the second stage
bootloader (SSBL) and the linux kernel. Secure booting of the first stage
bootloader (FSBL) is supported by tools found in ../ImageGenerator and
../../commands/otp_key.c.

Tools found in this folder:

1. generate_public_key_code:

  Given an RSA public key, generates C code that contains the necessary data for
  runtime verification of an image signed with the corresponding private key.
  For more details see rsa_verify.c in $(srcroot)/lib/rsa.

2. sign_image.py:

  Given an RSA private key and an image, generates an identical image with a
  header that includes the length of the image and a signed SHA1 hash of the
  image (i.e. such as is generated by openssl dgst -sha1 -sign private.key
  image.bin.) The resultant image can be booted by a secure uLoader/Barebox
  that is using the same key.
